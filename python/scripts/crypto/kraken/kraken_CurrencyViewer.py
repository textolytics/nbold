v0.1.2
Fixing bugs and cleaning code
1. Displays the different amount of crypto currencies you own on your Kraken wallet.
2. Displays the total crypto money you own in equivalent fiat money.
3. Adapted to the crypto and fiat currencies you already own.
4. If you don't own any fiat money on your Kraken wallet, it will be displayed the equivalent in USD.
(The fiat money can be easily modified but be aware that some markets doesn't allow it,
DASHUSD -> DASHJPY for example, can't be done because the market doesn't exist on Kraken.
Check k.query_public('Ticker',{'pair': 'YOURMARKET',}) inline to know if it exist.
5. Works with multi-fiat currencies wallets.
NOTE: Fiat currencies like JPY doesn't have as many markets as USD on Krakenex.
Crypto currencies that doesn't cover these markets, with JPY for example, aren't converted yet
Only markets with JPY are counted in the total sum values
This issue will be fixed with the next commit
NOTE2: Please be aware that only the markets with direct fiat conversion are covered yet
